# Aiding-Glasses-for-Blind-people
This project of mine is used to help blind people navigate the world. Since they can't see, it would be important for them to avoid collisions of any sort while walking. This project, a prototype, is a gateway to enable blind people to use glasses that help them detect objects near them using ultrasonic sensors and buzzers.
